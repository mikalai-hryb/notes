### How to tell a computer what type of an interpreter to use for a script file?

The beginning of a script file should start with `#!/bin/bash` on its own line.

Or with `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.

### How to work with data streams (stdin, stdout, and stderr)?

[What standard data streams do you know?](./linux.md#what-standard-data-streams-do-you-know)

script.sh > file.txt  # redirect stdout
script.sh 1> file.txt  # redirect stdout (the same as >)
script.sh 2> file.txt  # redirect stderr
script.sh 1> file.txt 2> file2.txt  # redirect stdout and stderr to files independently
script.sh > file.txt 2>&1 # 2>&1 - redirect stream 2, stderr, to the same destination that stream 1, stdout, is being redirected to
script.sh > /dev/null 2>&1 # thrown away both stdout and stderr silently
```
