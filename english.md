You have launched an EC2 instance that will host a NodeJS application.
You want to ensure your EC2 instances have the highest networking performance while communicating with each other

let's deep dive into the distinction

we scaled up our t2.micro incstance into t3.medioum

EC2 instances are fronted by LB
we will explore these concepts obviously in a deeper dive

You have an Auto Scaling Group fronted by an Application Load Balancer.

Once you eliminate the possibility of language misconfiguration, version mismatching, or state discrepancies, consider bringing your issue to the core Terraform team or Terraform provider community as a bug report.

deepen your understanding of how

The variables you have used so far have all been single values.

A likely place to use list variables is

 consider which resource arguments to expose to module end users as input variables.

Expression references let Terraform understand which value the reference `derives from`

 we recommend using expression references to `imply` dependencies when possible

 This was `fragile`

 However

 Terraform `defers` reading data resources in the following situations

The description should `concisely` explain the purpose of the variable

For `commentary` for module maintainers, use comments.

Terraform may treat the entire block as `redacted`.

which can help you `spot the mistake`.

Variable `precedence` within Terraform tests

`For brevity,` output values are ...

and so it should be written from the perspective of the user of the module `rather than` its maintainer

The expressions in local values `are not limited to literal constants`

A module that has been called by another module `is` often `referred to as` a child module
