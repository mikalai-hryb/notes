Once you eliminate the possibility of language misconfiguration, version mismatching, or state discrepancies, consider bringing your issue to the core Terraform team or Terraform provider community as a bug report.

The variables you have used so far have all been single values.

A likely place to use list variables is

 consider which resource arguments to expose to module end users as input variables.

Expression references let Terraform understand which value the reference `derives from`

 we recommend using expression references to `imply` dependencies when possible

 This was `fragile`

 However

 Terraform `defers` reading data resources in the following situations

The description should `concisely` explain the purpose of the variable

For `commentary` for module maintainers, use comments.

Terraform may treat the entire block as `redacted`.

which can help you `spot the mistake`.

Variable `precedence` within Terraform tests

`For brevity,` output values are ...

and so it should be written from the perspective of the user of the module `rather than` its maintainer

The expressions in local values `are not limited to literal constants`

A module that has been called by another module `is` often `referred to as` a child module
