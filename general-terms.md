# Terms

## Authentication
Authentication verifies the identity of a user or service. It checks if
user exists in/belongs to the system.

## Authorization
Authorization determines the access rights. It provides the permissions.

## Bandwidth
The maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over an internet connection
in a given amount of time.

## Bootstrap
Bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts.

## CLI
CLI - is a text-based interface used to interact with a computer program or
system by typing commands into a terminal or command prompt.

## CPU
CPU - Central Processing Unit.

## Discrete Data Center
A discrete data center refers to a type of data center infrastructure that is
physically separate or distinct from other data center facilities. It is
designed to operate independently and is often dedicated to specific functions
or applications.

## Disk
"Disk" is the word used by Unix systems to refer to physical storage devices.
Disks contain volumes and can contain multiple volumes of different sizes.
A disk is like the parent container for all the logical divisions of storage
that might come below it.

## Drive
A drive is a physical device that’s used to store data. It’s not really a formal
term but a commonly-used one. The term is often used informally to refer to any
storage device, from a disk to a volume.

## HPC
HPC - High-Performance Computing (applications).

## Image
Images function like [volumes](#volume), but they have no physical hardware
related to them. They’re like a picture of a physical volume, containing every
bit stored on the captured volume. You can create an image of any volume,
whether it’s stored on a hard drive or a CD, and store it on any other device
with sufficient free space.

## IOPS
IOPS  - IO operations per seconds.

## ISP
ISP - Internet Service Provider

## Latency
Latency is sometimes referred to as delay or ping rate. It's the lag you
experience while waiting for something to load. If bandwidth is the amount of
information sent per second, latency is the amount of time it takes that
information to get from its source to you.

## Network capacity
Network capacity refers to the maximum information transfer limit of a network
at any given point.

## NFS
NFS - Network File System.

## Partition
A partition is very much like a [volume](#volume). In fact, the two terms are
used almost interchangeably. A "partition" is a chunk of a disk. It doesn’t
necessarily contain a file system, and it might not be formatted to store data.
Instead, a partition is just a part of a disk with a specific size, which is set
at the time of creation. A partition can be resized, but it requires re-writing
the disk’s partition table and possibly erasing data.

## RAM
RAM - Random-Access Memory.

## SDK
SDK - Software Development Kit. It is a collection of software tools,
libraries, documentation, and resources that developers use to create
applications for specific platforms, frameworks, or programming languages.

## Storage Devices
* [Drive](#drive)
* [Disk](#disk)
* [Partition](#partition)
* [Volume](#volume)
* [Image](#image)

## Storage types
* block-level storage
* file-level storage
* object-level storage

## Throughput
Throughput is how much information actually gets delivered in a certain amount
of time. So if bandwidth is the max amount of data, throughput is how much of
that data makes it to its destination – taking latency,
network speed,
packet loss and other factors into account.

## VDS
VDS - Virtual Dedicated Server.

## VPS
VPS - Virtual Private Server.

## Virtual Server
A virtual server is located in the cloud or in an offsite data center and shares
hardware and software resources with other virtual servers.

## Volume
A volume is the part of the disk that you interact with as a user. While
[partitions](#partition) and volumes are coterminal, a volume has a name and
file system in addition to a size. When you mount a
[storage device](#storage-devices) and its icon appears in your file browser,
you’re seeing the volume.
