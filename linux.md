# Linux

## Short overview

In 1969 the UNIX (UNiplexed Information Computing System) OC was developed.
It was a proprietary software.

In 1983 the GNU (GNU is Not Unix) project was started.
GNU is an operating system that is free software.

In 1991 Linus Torvalds created the Linux OC which was based on Minix (Unix-compatible operating system for personal computers).
The Linux uses GNU General Public License (GPL).

Linux today is a family of Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, including one or another set of utilities and programs of the GNU project.

### What is the Linux distribution?

It's an OC based on Linux kernel which includes a collection of libraries and packages developed within the GNU project, as well as a package management system (package manager).

### What is the library in Linux?

A library in Linux is a collection of precompiled code that provides specific functionality to applications.
Libraries can be packaged as part of larger software packages.

### What is the package in Linux

While a package is a collection of files and metadata used for distributing and managing software on Linux systems.
Packages can also contain executables, configuration files, and other resources beyond just libraries.

### What package type distributions do you know?

* DEB-based (use .deb format of packages)
Debian, Ubuntu, Astra Linux

* RPM-based (use .rpm format of packages)
RedHat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Fedora

### What package managers do you know?

Debian-based
apt, DPKG (it's a backend of apt, it's working with local packages only)

RPM-based
yum, RPM (it's a backend of yum, it's working with local packages only)

### What is the difference between the CLI, Shell and Terminal in Linux?

The CLI is a method of interacting with a computer's operating system or software using text commands entered through a command line interface.

The shell is the program responsible for interpreting text commands and passing them to OC.

The Terminal in Linux refers specifically to a software application that provides a graphical interface for accessing the CLI.

### What is SSH?

SSH - Secure SHell, it is a network protocol that gives users a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network. It uses server-client architecture.

### What SSH agents you know?

PuTTY for Windows
command ssh for Linux and MacOS

### What file types do you know? `ls -l`

byte (B)
1 kilobyte (KB) = 1000 B    = 10^3  B
1 megabyte (MB) = 1000 KB   = 10^6  B
1 gigabyte (GB) = 1000 MB   = 10^9  B
1 terabyte (TB) = 1000 GB   = 10^12 B
1 petabyte (PB) = 1000 TB   = 10^15 B

1 kibibyte (KiB) = 1024 B   = 2^10  B
1 mebibyte (MiB) = 1024 KiB = 2^20  B
1 gibibyte (GiB) = 1024 MiB = 2^30  B
1 tebibyte (TiB) = 1024 GiB = 2^40  B
1 pebibyte (PiB) = 1024 TiB = 2^50  B
