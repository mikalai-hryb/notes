## Latency
Latency is sometimes referred to as delay or ping rate. It's the lag you
experience while waiting for something to load. If bandwidth is the amount of
information sent per second, latency is the amount of time it takes that
information to get from its source to you.

## Network capacity
Network capacity refers to the maximum information transfer limit of a network
at any given point.

## SDK
SDK - Software Development Kit. It is a collection of software tools,
libraries, documentation, and resources that developers use to create
applications for specific platforms, frameworks, or programming languages.

## Throughput
Throughput is how much information actually gets delivered in a certain amount
of time. So if bandwidth is the max amount of data, throughput is how much of
that data makes it to its destination â€“ taking latency, 
network speed,
packet loss and other factors into account.
